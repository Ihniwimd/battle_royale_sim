# The Event class provides the generic framework for in-game events, providing the main structure common to all events.
# Because Events can have arbitrary effects, each event defined must have a .py file that extends this class, registering
# a callback for the delegator doEvent with the convenience function registerEvent, provided below.

# Note that it is very likely feasible to define some helper methods (like kill_player) here that events can call for common
# shared events.
