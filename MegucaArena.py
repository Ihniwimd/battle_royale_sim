# Run simulation
# If we're going to have a cornucopia, we should remember to set up some way to have a special turn: maybe as a separate object?
# In any case a special turn would have unique base event weights.

# General pseudocode idea
# Sample contestants randomly
# Go through contestants
# For each contestant, go through event list and poll their weights + contestant weight modifiers (base weights + object and relationship modifiers)
# (Remember that base event weights may change based on turn)
# (For multi-contestant events, there should also be a weight stored for a) being a "participant" on the side of whoever started the event and b) being a "victim"
# These should affect the final weight used (I should figure out a formula for this) and also be used to pick secondary participants/victims.
# Using these weights, pick an event and call its method. If multi-contestant, also make sure not to let them roll another event.
# Check that this turn has not killed everyone. If it has, redo the _entire_ turn (it's the only fair way).
# Then print results into HTML (?) or whatever makes sense
# Repeat.
